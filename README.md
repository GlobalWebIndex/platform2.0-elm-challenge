This is an assignment app built with React, via Next.js. It lets users see random cat images via an API, save their favorites, and check information on their breeds.

## Features 

* Next.js implementation (SSR, routing, Image and Link optimizations, and much more).
* Cookies for saving user state on refresh.
* Typescript, for type checking and more sustainable and maintainable codebase.
* React context, to share state and avoid prop drilling.
* Jest testing, though due to lack of time, not many were implemented.
* Tailwind used for theming.
* Multilingual support
* Static data like endpoints, and configuration stored in centralised configuration files.
