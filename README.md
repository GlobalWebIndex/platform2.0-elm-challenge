# MEOW Project for GWI
This project was based on Create React App. 

CRA provides a good set of defaults for React, especially with how complex the modern front-end has become.

# Libraries reasoning

### React Router
Currently, the most used router option, although not official, for any React based SPA project. 

### Zustand
Why not Redux? Redux in my opinion requires a lot of boilerplate in order to achieve something simple. Zustand 
is simple to setup but already used for large applications, while providing, out of the box, many sensible defaults
and useful pluing e.g. persist.

### React Helmet
Although not SSR based CRA can add all necessary meta tags AND change them while navigating with React Router by using 
React Helmet. 

### Axios
Axios is still one of the best available options for ajax requests especially with many features e.g. interceptors.

### PrimeReact
PrimeReact is a feature complete UI library for React, while the setup is fast.
