# Cat Lover App

## Instructions

- node version: as specified in .nvmrc
- open a console and run yarn to install node_modules
- to start the project in your default browser: yarn start
- create a .env file with X_API_KEY=<your_api_key> to be able to perform api calls

## Things I didn't have time to implement

- Fix Typescript validations
- Complete the "page not found"
- Handle security for api key using express instead of .env
- Unit test components
