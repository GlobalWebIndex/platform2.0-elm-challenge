# GWI Challenge

## CatLover

The purpose of this project is to re-do the Catlover challenge 6 months after the 1st time using the stack and patterns I learned during that time with the gwi team ðŸ¤˜ &#10084; in order to further practice and see what's changed. (if anything) <br /><br/>
The project created without using create-react-app in order to better understand webpack, babel and the actual starting to ending flow of building a React app.
