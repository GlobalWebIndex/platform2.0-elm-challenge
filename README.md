# GWI Challenge

## CatLover

The purpose of this project is to re-do the Catlover challenge 6 months after the 1st time using the stack and patterns I learned during that time with the gwi team. <br />
The project created without using create-react-app in order to better understand webpack, babel and the actual starting to ending flow of building a React app.
